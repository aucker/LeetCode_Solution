## Problem
Write an SQL query to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in **any order**.
>Table: `Visits`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
visit_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.
```
>Table: `Transactions`
```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |
+----------------+---------+
transaction_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.
```

### Example
```
Input: 
Visits
+----------+-------------+
| visit_id | customer_id |
+----------+-------------+
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |
+----------+-------------+
Transactions
+----------------+----------+--------+
| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
+----------------+----------+--------+
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |
+----------------+----------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
```

## Solution: 

When count the number, use the `group by` function.

I solution is so slow<3

```sql
select v.customer_id, count(v.customer_id) as count_no_trans
from Visits v left join Transactions t using(visit_id)
where v.visit_id not in (select visit_id from Transactions)
group by customer_id
```
